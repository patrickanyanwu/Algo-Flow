## Algorithms Explained

### Pathfinding Algorithms

#### üîπ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Type**: Unweighted
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) (V is number of Tiles and E is number of neighbours for each tile = (4V))
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ
- **How it works**: Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level. Think of it as expanding outward in circles.

#### üîπ Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Type**: Unweighted
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚ùå
- **How it works**: Explores one neighbor fully before backtracking. May go deep into one branch before trying alternatives.

#### üîπ Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Type**: Weighted (but all weights = 1 in grid)
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ
- **How it works**: Uses a priority queue to explore the closest node first (based on total distance from start). Expands outward intelligently.

#### üîπ A* Search
- **Type**: Weighted with Heuristic
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ (with admissible heuristic like Manhattan distance)
- **How it works**: Like Dijkstra‚Äôs, but adds a **heuristic estimate** to prioritize nodes that are closer to the goal. Much faster.

#### üîπ Greedy Best-First Search  
- **Type**: Heuristic-Only (Weighted)
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚ùå  
- **How it works**: Prioritizes nodes **purely based on their estimated distance to the goal** (heuristic). It ignores the actual cost to reach a node, making it faster but potentially inaccurate. Greedy is fast and visually efficient, but may take suboptimal paths.

### Maze Generation Algorithms

#### Manual Wall Placement
- **Description**: Click any grid tile to add or remove a wall. Great for testing specific cases.

#### Binary Tree Maze
- **Time Complexity**: O(V)
- **Description**: A simple randomized algorithm that creates a maze by carving paths with only right and down directions. Fast but not very complex.

#### Recursive Division
- **Time Complexity**: O(V log V)
- **Description**: Recursively divides the grid into sections with walls and openings. Creates visually interesting and solvable mazes.
