# AlgoFlow

**AlgoFlow** is an interactive pathfinding and maze generation visualizer built using modern web technologies. It allows users to explore how different algorithms work through smooth animations and full user control over speed, algorithms and wall placement.

## Technologies Used

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Features

- **Visualize Pathfinding Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and A* (with heuristics)
- **Maze Generation**: Create walls manually or generate random mazes using:
  - Binary Tree algorithm
  - Recursive Division algorithm
- **Adjustable Animation Speeds**: Choose between slow, medium, or fast
- **Interactive UI**: Click to add/remove walls and reposition start/end tiles

## Algorithms Explained

### Pathfinding Algorithms

#### üîπ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Type**: Unweighted
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ
- **How it works**: Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level. Think of it as expanding outward in circles.

#### üîπ Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Type**: Unweighted
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚ùå
- **How it works**: Explores one neighbor fully before backtracking. May go deep into one branch before trying alternatives.

#### üîπ Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Type**: Weighted (but all weights = 1 in grid)
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ
- **How it works**: Uses a priority queue to explore the closest node first (based on total distance from start). Expands outward intelligently.

#### üîπ A* Search
- **Type**: Weighted with Heuristic
- **Guarantees Shortest Path**: ‚úÖ (with admissible heuristic like Manhattan distance)
- **How it works**: Like Dijkstra‚Äôs, but adds a **heuristic estimate** to prioritize nodes that are closer to the goal. Much faster.

### Maze Generation Algorithms

#### Manual Wall Placement
- **Description**: Click any grid tile to add or remove a wall. Great for testing specific cases.

#### Binary Tree Maze
- **Description**: A simple randomized algorithm that creates a maze by carving paths with only right and down directions. Fast but not very complex.

#### Recursive Division
- **Description**: Recursively divides the grid into sections with walls and openings. Creates visually interesting and solvable mazes.
